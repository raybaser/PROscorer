<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>This vignette includes descriptions of the instruments scored by the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=PROscorer">PROscorer</a>
package.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> Patient reported outcome (PRO) measures and
other PRO-like instruments are often poorly and inadequately described
in formal research protocol documents and in published reports of study
results.</p>
<p><strong>CONSEQUENCES:</strong> In protocols, this makes it difficult
or impossible to evaluate the suitability of the PRO measures as study
outcomes, including whether the proposed analysis plans are appropriate.
The same consequences apply to published study results. In addition,
poor PRO measure descriptions in published studies hinder the ability
interpret, replicate, and reproduce study results. Altogether, this
impedes the scientific progress of research that relies upon PRO and
similar measures.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Create a repository of high-quality
descriptions of specific PRO instruments (i.e., this vignette document),
written according to explicit guidelines for describing PRO measures in
research protocols and papers.</p>
<p>This document is intended to ease the burden of writing research
protocols and manuscripts for studies with quality of life (QOL) or
other patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as endpoints.</p>
<p>The descriptions are written with sufficient detail to be included in
formal research protocol documents that utilize the instruments as
outcome measures. They are also suitable for the “Measures” subsection
of manuscripts reporting the results of such studies (potentially with
editing, to meet word limits). They were written with these purposes in
mind, and follow the below <em>“Guidelines for Describing PRO
Measures”</em> that I developed based on several sources of “best
practices” for describing PRO measures (references coming soon) and on
my personal experience as a protocol review committee chair at a large
cancer center.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-these-descriptions" class="section level1">
<h1>How to Use These Descriptions:</h1>
<p>Each instrument description is complete with relevant references. In
most cases, the description can be copied and pasted directly into your
document with only very minor modifications.</p>
<p>The following modifications are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Move the references to the References section of the your
document, and update in-text citation numbers accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>If not all of the scored scales of the instrument are of interest
to the study objectives, then add a sentence indicating the focal scale
scores.</p></li>

<h1>Guidelines for Describing Patient Reported Outcome Measures
(PROMs):</h1>
<p>I developed the following guidelines during my years of service as a
chair of the Biostatistics Protocol Review Committee at a large cancer
treatment and research institution. If you would like to contribute a
scoring function to the PROscorer package, please use these guidelines
to write a description of your instrument. I plan to update these
guidelines soon into a more user-friendly checklist, but this should get
you started.</p>
<p>Information to Include in Descriptions of PRO Measures:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The total number of questions/items on the instrument(s), their
response format (e.g., 5-point Likert scale, True/False, etc.), and the
time period for which respondents are asked to consider each item (e.g.,
“In past week, how often …”).</p></li>
<li><p>The names of any subscale scores that the instrument yields,
descriptions of the specific constructs that each of these subscales are
intended to measure, the number of items included on each subscale, the
range of scores that is possible on each subscale, the interpretation of
higher scores (e.g., higher scores indicate more/less severe symptom
levels), and, if available, reliability coefficients (e.g., internal
consistency, test-retest) for each subscale score and, if relevant, for
the instrument’s total score.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Many PROM scores have validated cut-points that divide the scores
into 2 or more range categories believed to be clinically or
diagnostically relevant. If the PROM has such score categories, provide
the score cut-points or ranges defining each category as well as the
clinical interpretation of each category.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A citation and reference to the instrument’s original
psychometric validation study, and any relevant subsequent validation
studies. At least one reference should indicate how the instrument is
scored. Please also mention the <em>PROscorer</em> R package and the
relevant <em>PROscorer</em> scoring function, and please cite the
<em>PROscorer</em> R package.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimates of how long it will take study participants to complete
the PROM, as well as an estimate of how long it will take them to
complete the full battery of PROMs.</p></li>

<div id="female-sexual-function-index-fsfi" class="section level2">
<h2>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</strong> is a
multidimensional self-report measure of female sexual
functioning<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. It asks women to rate its 19 items
according to “the past 4 weeks” using a Likert-type response format.
Four of the items are scored from 1 to 5, and fifteen are scored from 0
to 5 (with 0 corresponding to response option “Did not attempt
intercourse”). It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>In additional to the FSFI Total score, the FSFI produces 6 subscale
scores corresponding to distinct sexual function domains: Desire (2
items), Arousal (4 items), Lubrication (4 items), Orgasm (3 items),
Satisfaction (3 items), and Pain (3 items). The FSFI scoring algorithm
sums the items on each subscale and then scales the sums so that each
subscale has a maximum possible score of 6. The subscales have a minimum
possible score of 0 except for Desire and Satisfaction, which have
minimum possible scores of 1.2 and 0.8, respectively. This is because
those two subscales contain the four items scored 1 to 5 (instead of 0
to 5). The FSFI total score is the sum of the 6 subscale scores and
ranges from 2 to 36. Higher scores indicate better functioning for all
scores. Accurate scoring for the FSFI is available in the
<em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>fsfi()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
2]</strong>.</p>
<p>The initial FSFI validation study<strong>[REF 1]</strong> reported
excellent internal consistency reliability for the FSFI total score
(Cronbach’s α = 0.97) and subscales (Cronbach’s α range = 0.89 to 0.96).
A FSFI total score of 26.55 or less has been validated as a diagnostic
cut off score suggestive of female sexual dysfunction<strong>[REF
3]</strong>. The FSFI has also been validated for assessing sexual
function among sexually active female cancer survivors<strong>[REF
4]</strong>.</p>

<h2>Cognitive Causation (CC) and Negative Affect in Risk (NAR)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cognitive Causation (CC)</strong> and <strong>Negative
Affect in Risk (NAR)</strong> scales are two new measures of intuitive,
gut-level aspects of cancer risk perception<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. The
CC scale measures the extent to which respondents believe that thoughts
about cancer risk can encourage the development of the disease, and that
minimizing such thoughts can actually reduce cancer risk. It originally
contained 10 items<strong>[REF 1]</strong>, but it is recommended to
score only 7 items<strong>[REF 2]</strong>. The NAR scale contains 6
items and measures negative anticipatory affect, or negative emotions
(e.g., fear) generated during cancer risk information processing. Both
the CC and NAR items have 4, Likert-type response options that are
assigned numeric scores: Strongly Disagree = 0, Disagree = 1, Agree = 2,
and Strongly Agree = 3. Each instrument takes approximately 2-5 minutes
to complete.</p>
<p>The preferred scoring method is to first calculate the mean of the
item scores, and then transform that mean to range from 0 to 100. Higher
scores indicate greater levels of the constructs being
measured<strong>[REF 2]</strong>. A score should only be assigned to
respondents who validly completed at least half of items on a given
scale. The CC and NAR scales can be accurately scored using the
<strong><code>narcc()</code></strong> function in the <em>PROscorer</em>
R package <strong>[REF 3]</strong>.</p>
<p>Both scales have had consistently high reliability across diverse
samples, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients all 0.89 or
higher<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. The items have also demonstrated
measurement invariance across highly diverse samples<strong>[REF
2]</strong>.</p>

<h2>EORTC QLQ-BLM30</h2>
<p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) QLQ-BLM30 Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Module is a 30-item
questionnaire designed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.<strong>[REF 1]</strong>
The questionnaire asks patients to indicate the extent to which they
have experienced each of the problems “during the past week” on a
4-point Likert-type response scale from “Not at all” to “Very much”.</p>
<p>The 30 items of the QLQ-BLM30 yield 7 scale scores. Of the 7 scores,
6 are Symptom Scales and 1 is a Functional Scale. Five of the Symptom
Scales are based on multiple items: Urinary Symptoms (7 items), Urostomy
Problems (6 items), Future Perspective (3 items), Abdominal Bloating and
Flatulence (2 items), and Body Image (3 items). One Symptom Scale is
based on a single item (Catheter Use Problems). The single Functional
Scale, Sexual Functioning, is based on either 2, 4, 6, or 7 items,
depending on whether the respondent is male or female and whether he or
she is sexually active. Psychometric validation results for the
QLQ-BLM30 are lacking.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>
<p>The scoring procedure for the QLQ-BLM30 (available at <a href="https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/" class="uri">https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/</a>) transforms all of
the scale and single-item scores to range from 0 to 100. High scores for
the functional scale represent high/healthy levels of functioning, but
high scores for the symptom scales/items represent high levels of
symptomatology/problems. Accurate scoring for the EORTC QLQ-BLM30 is
available in the <em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>qlq_blm30()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
2]</strong>. Note that the QLQ-BLM30 instructs respondents to answer
subsets of questions conditional on whether they have a urostomy or not,
whether they used a catheter during the past week, whether they are a
man or a woman, and whether they have been sexually active during the
past 4 weeks. Therefore, not all of the scale scores are applicable to
all patients.</p>

<h2>EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0)</h2>
<p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire (version 3.0) is a 30-item
questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life of cancer
patients<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. The 30 items of the QLQ-C30 yield both
multi-item scale scores and single-item scores, for a total of 16
distinct scores. These include one Global Health Status/QoL scale (2
items), five functional scales (Physical Functioning, 5 items; Role
Functioning, 2 items; Emotional Functioning, 4 items; Cognitive
Functioning, 2 items; and Social Functioning, 2 items), three symptom
scales (Fatigue, 3 items; Nausea and Vomiting, 2 items; and Pain, 2
items), six single item symptom scores (Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite
Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, and Financial Difficulties; all from
single items), and the more recently validated overall summary score
(calculated from the other scores, excluding Global Health Status/QoL
and Financial Difficulties)<strong>[REF 2]</strong>. The questionnaire
asks patients to indicate the extent to which they have experienced each
of the problems “during the past week” on a 4-point Likert-type scale
from “Not at all” to “Very much”. The 2 exceptions are the 2 items of
the Global Health Status/QoL scale, which patients are asked to rate on
a 7-point scale from “Very poor” to “Excellent”.</p>
<p>The scoring procedure for the QLQ-C30<strong>[REF 3]</strong>
transforms all of the scale and single-item scores to range from 0 to
100. High scores for the Global Health Status/QoL scale represents high
QoL, high scores for the functional scales represent high/healthy levels
of functioning, but high scores for the symptom scales/items represent
high levels of symptomatology/problems. The newer overall summary score
also ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better
functioning and lower levels of symptoms. Accurate scoring for the EORTC
QLQ-C30 (version 3.0), including the newer overall summary score, is
available in the <em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>qlq_c30()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
4]</strong>. The QLQ-C30 has been extensively validated and is widely
used in clinical trials. The multi-item scales generally have good
internal consistency reliability coefficients<strong>[REF
1]</strong>.</p>

8 are Symptom Scales and 4 are Functional Scales. Seven of the Symptom
Scales are based on multiple items: Micturition Problems (3 items),
Gastrointestinal Tract Symptoms (5 items), Chemotherapy Side-Effects (3
items), Problems with Defecation (Only for Pts WITHOUT a stoma) (7
items), Stoma-Related Problems (Only for Pts w/stoma) (7 items), Male
Sexual Problems (2 items), and Female Sexual Problems (2 items). There
is 1 single-item symptom scale (Weight Loss). Two of the Functional
Scales are based on multiple items: Body Image (3 items), and Sexual
Functioning (2 items). The other 2 Functional Scales are based on single
items (Sexual Enjoyment and Future Perspective).</p>
<p>Note that the QLQ-CR38 instructs respondents to answer subsets of
questions conditional on whether they have a have a stoma or not,
whether they are a man or a woman, and whether they have been sexually
active during the past 4 weeks. Therefore, not all of the scale scores
are applicable to all patients.</p>
<p>The scoring procedure for the QLQ-CR38 transforms all of the scale
and single-item scores to range from 0 to 100. High scores for the
functional scale represent high/healthy levels of functioning, but high
scores for the symptom scales/items represent high levels of
symptomatology/problems. Accurate scoring for the EORTC QLQ-CR38 is
available in the <em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>qlq_cr38()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
2]</strong>. The scoring instructions for the QLQ-CR38 are no longer
available on the EORTC website, and the QLQ-CR38 seems to have been
superseded by the QLQ-CR29<strong>[REF 3]</strong>, which was designed
in response to concerns that the QLQ-CR38 was outdated and no longer
adequately assessed the side effects and possible functional advantages
of current treatment regiments for colorectal cancer.</p>

<h2>EORTC QLQ-CX24</h2>
<p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) QLQ-CX24 Cervical Cancer Module is a 24-item questionnaire
designed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients
with cervical cancer.<strong>[REF 1]</strong><br />
The questionnaire asks patients to indicate the extent to which they
have experienced each of the problems “during the past week” on a
4-point Likert-type response scale from “Not at all” to “Very much”.</p>
<p>The 24 items of the QLQ-CX24 yield both multi-item scale scores and
single-item scores, for a total of 9 distinct scores. Of the 9 scores, 7
are Symptom Scales and 2 are Functional Scales. Three of the Symptom
Scales are based on multiple items: Symptom Experience (11 items), Body
Image (3 items), and Sexual/Vaginal Functioning (4 items). The other 4
Symptom Scales (Lymphoedema, Peripheral Neuropathy, Menopausal Symptoms,
and Sexual Worry) and both Functional Scales (Sexual Activity, Sexual
Enjoyment) are all based on single items. In the original psychometric
validation study of the QLQ-CX24, internal consistency reliability
coefficients for the multi-item scales were 0.72 for Symptom Experience,
0.86 for Body Image, and 0.87 for Sexual/Vaginal
Functioning.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>
<p>The scoring procedure for the QLQ-CX24 (available at <a href="https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/" class="uri">https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/</a>) transforms all of
the scale and single-item scores to range from 0 to 100. High scores for

symptomatology/problems. Accurate scoring for the EORTC QLQ-CX24 is
available in the <em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>qlq_cx24()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
2]</strong>. Note that the QLQ-CX24 instructs respondents to answer the
last 5 questions on the instrument <strong>only</strong> if they have
been sexually active during the past 4 weeks. These 5 items include all
4 items on the Sexual/Vaginal Functioning symptom scale and the 1 item
on the Sexual Enjoyment functional scale. These scale scores will be
missing for respondents who were not sexually active during the 4 weeks
before completing the questionnaire.</p>

<h2>EORTC QLQ-PAN26</h2>
<p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) QLQ-PAN26 Pancreatic Cancer Module is a 26-item questionnaire
designed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients
with pancreatic cancer. <strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks
patients to indicate the extent to which they have experienced each of
the problems “during the past week” on a 4-point Likert-type response
scale from “Not at all” to “Very much”. The 26 items of the QLQ-PAN26
yield both multi-item scale scores and single-item scores, for a total
of 17 distinct scores. These include two multi-item functional scales
(Satisfaction with Health Care, 2 items; Sexuality, 2 items), five
multi-item symptom scales (Pancreatic Pain, 4 items; Digestive Symptoms,
2 items; Hepatic Symptoms, 2 items; Altered Bowel Habit, 2 items; Body
Image, 2 items;), and 10 single item symptom scales (Bloating, Taste,
Indigestion, Flatulence, Weight Loss, Weakness in Arms and Legs, Dry
Mouth, Troubled with Side-Effects, Future Worries, and Planning of
Activities).<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. In a large psychometric validation
study of the QLQ-PAN26, internal consistency reliability coefficients
for the multi-item scales were generally above 0.70 at the pre-surgical
baseline assessment as well as at 14- and 60-day post-surgical
assessments, with the exception of the Hepatic Symptoms scale which had
poor post-surgery reliability.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The scoring procedure for the QLQ-PAN26 (available at <a href="https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/" class="uri">https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/</a>) transforms all of
the scale and single-item scores to range from 0 to 100. High scores for

symptomatology/problems. Accurate scoring for the EORTC QLQ-PAN26 is
available in the <em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>qlq_pan26()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
3]</strong>.</p>
<p>NOTE: At the time this scoring function was written (April 2022), the
QLQ-PAN26 had completed Phase 3 testing; however, the official scoring
instructions from the EORTC warned that this scaling structure is still
preliminary and may change in the future (see <a href="https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/" class="uri">https://qol.eortc.org/questionnaires/</a>).</p>
