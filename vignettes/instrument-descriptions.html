<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>This vignette includes descriptions of the instruments scored by the
<a href="cran.r-project.org/package=PROscorer">PROscorer</a>
package.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> Patient reported outcome (PRO) measures and
other PRO-like instruments are often poorly and inadequately described
in formal research protocol documents and in published reports of study
results.</p>
<p><strong>CONSEQUENCES:</strong> In protocols, this makes it difficult
or impossible to evaluate the suitability of the PRO measures as study
outcomes, including whether the proposed analysis plans are appropriate.
The same consequences apply to published study results. In addition,
poor PRO measure descriptions in published studies hinder the ability
interpret, replicate, and reproduce study results. Altogether, this
impedes the scientific progress of research that relies upon PRO and
similar measures.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Create a repository of high-quality
descriptions of specific PRO instruments (i.e., this vignette document),
written according to explicit guidelines for describing PRO measures in
research protocols and papers.</p>
<p>This document is intended to ease the burden of writing research
protocols and manuscripts for studies with quality of life (QOL) or
other patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as endpoints.</p>
<p>The descriptions are written with sufficient detail to be included in
formal research protocol documents that utilize the instruments as
outcome measures. They are also suitable for the “Measures” subsection
of manuscripts reporting the results of such studies (potentially with
editing, to meet word limits). They were written with these purposes in
mind, and follow the below <em>“Guidelines for Describing PRO
Measures”</em> that I developed based on several sources of “best
practices” for describing PRO measures (references coming soon) and on
my personal experience as a protocol review committee chair at a large
cancer center.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-these-descriptions" class="section level1">
<h1>How to Use These Descriptions:</h1>
<p>Each instrument description is complete with relevant references. In
most cases, the description can be copied and pasted directly into your
document with only very minor modifications.</p>
<p>The following modifications are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Move the references to the References section of the your
document, and update in-text citation numbers accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>If not all of the scored scales of the instrument are of interest
to the study objectives, then add a sentence indicating the focal scale
scores.</p></li>

to obtain DOIs soon):</p>

<h1>Guidelines for Describing PRO Measures:</h1>
<p>I developed the following guidelines during my years of service as a
chair of the Biostatistics Protocol Review Committee at a large cancer
treatment and research institution. If you would like to contribute a
scoring function to the PROscorer package, please use these guidelines
to write a description of your instrument. I plan to update these
guidelines soon into a more user-friendly checklist, but this should get
you started.</p>
<p>Information to Include in Descriptions of PRO Measures:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The total number of questions/items on the instrument(s), their
response format (e.g., 5-point Likert scale, True/False, etc.), and the
time period for which respondents are asked to consider each item (e.g.,
“In past week, how often …”).</p></li>
<li><p>The names of any subscale scores that the instrument yields,
descriptions of the specific constructs that each of these subscales are
intended to measure, the number of items included on each subscale, the
range of scores that is possible on each subscale, the interpretation of
higher scores (e.g., higher scores indicate more/less severe symptom
levels), and, if available, reliability coefficients (e.g., internal
consistency, test-retest) for each subscale score and, if relevant, for
the instrument’s total score.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If not all of the instrument’s scales are relevant to evaluating the
study objective, please indicate which scale scores will be
utilized.</li>
<li>Many PROM scores have validated cut-points that divide the scores
into 2 or more range categories believed to be clinically or
diagnostically relevant. If the protocol PROM scores will be
categorized, provide the score cut-points or ranges defining each
category as well as the clinical interpretation of each category.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The PROM’s scoring instructions, or a citation and reference to a
publication containing the scoring instructions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A citation and reference to a publication containing the scoring
instructions, if available, is sufficient. Often, the scoring
instructions are included in the report of the PROM’s original
psychometric validation.</li>
<li>If the scoring instructions are unpublished, as might be the case
with a newly developed PROM, they must be included in the protocol,
possibly as an appendix.</li>
<li>Please also cite the <em>PROscorer</em> R package and this vignette
document (see previous section).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Estimates of how long it will take study participants to complete
each PROM, as well as an estimate of how long it will take them to
complete the full battery of PROMs.</p></li>

<div id="female-sexual-function-index-fsfi" class="section level2">
<h2>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</strong> is a
multidimensional self-report measure of female sexual
functioning<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. It asks women to rate its 19 items
according to “the past 4 weeks” using a Likert-type response format.
Four of the items are scored from 1 to 5, and fifteen are scored from 0
to 5 (with 0 corresponding to response option “Did not attempt
intercourse”). It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>In additional to the FSFI Total score, the FSFI produces 6 subscale
scores corresponding to distinct sexual function domains: Desire (2
items), Arousal (4 items), Lubrication (4 items), Orgasm (3 items),
Satisfaction (3 items), and Pain (3 items). The FSFI scoring algorithm
sums the items on each subscale and then scales the sums so that each
subscale has a maximum possible score of 6. The subscales have a minimum
possible score of 0 except for Desire and Satisfaction, which have
minimum possible scores of 1.2 and 0.8, respectively. This is because
those two subscales contain the four items scored 1 to 5 (instead of 0
to 5). The FSFI total score is the sum of the 6 subscale scores and
ranges from 2 to 36. Higher scores indicate better functioning for all
scores. Accurate scoring for the FSFI is available in the
<em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>fsfi()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
2]</strong>.</p>
<p>The initial FSFI validation study<strong>[REF 1]</strong> reported
excellent internal consistency reliability for the FSFI total score
(Cronbach’s α = 0.97) and subscales (Cronbach’s α range = 0.89 to 0.96).
A FSFI total score of 26.55 or less has been validated as a diagnostic
cut off score suggestive of female sexual dysfunction<strong>[REF
3]</strong>. The FSFI has also been validated for assessing sexual
function among sexually active female cancer survivors<strong>[REF
4]</strong>.</p>

<h2>Cognitive Causation (CC) and Negative Affect in Risk (NAR)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cognitive Causation (CC)</strong> and <strong>Negative
Affect in Risk (NAR)</strong> scales are two new measures of intuitive,
gut-level aspects of cancer risk perception<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. The
CC scale measures the extent to which respondents believe that thoughts
about cancer risk can encourage the development of the disease, and that
minimizing such thoughts can actually reduce cancer risk. It originally
contained 10 items<strong>[REF 1]</strong>, but it is recommended to
score only 7 items<strong>[REF 2]</strong>. The NAR scale contains 6
items and measures negative anticipatory affect, or negative emotions
(e.g., fear) generated during cancer risk information processing. Both
the CC and NAR items have 4, Likert-type response options that are
assigned numeric scores: Strongly Disagree = 0, Disagree = 1, Agree = 2,
and Strongly Agree = 3. Each instrument takes approximately 2-5 minutes
to complete.</p>
<p>The preferred scoring method is to first calculate the mean of the
item scores, and then transform that mean to range from 0 to 100. Higher
scores indicate greater levels of the constructs being
measured<strong>[REF 2]</strong>. A score should only be assigned to
respondents who validly completed at least half of items on a given
scale. The CC and NAR scales can be accurately scored using the
<strong><code>narcc()</code></strong> function in the <em>PROscorer</em>
R package <strong>[REF 3]</strong>.</p>
<p>Both scales have had consistently high reliability across diverse
samples, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients all 0.89 or
higher<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. The items have also demonstrated
measurement invariance across highly diverse samples<strong>[REF
2]</strong>.</p>

<div id="eortc-qlq-c30-version-3.0" class="section level2">
<h2>EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0)</h2>
<p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire (version 3.0) is a 30-item
questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life of cancer
patients<strong>[REF 1]</strong>. The 30 items of the QLQ-C30 yield both
multi-item scale scores and single-item scores, for a total of 16
distinct scores. These include one Global Health Status/QoL scale (2
items), five functional scales (Physical Functioning, 5 items; Role
Functioning, 2 items; Emotional Functioning, 4 items; Cognitive
Functioning, 2 items; and Social Functioning, 2 items), three symptom
scales (Fatigue, 3 items; Nausea and Vomiting, 2 items; and Pain, 2
items), six single item symptom scores (Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite
Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, and Financial Difficulties; all from
single items), and the more recently validated overall summary score
(calculated from the other scores, excluding Global Health Status/QoL
and Financial Difficulties)<strong>[REF 2]</strong>. The questionnaire
asks patients to indicate the extent to which they have experienced each
of the problems “during the past week” on a 4-point Likert-type scale
from “Not at all” to “Very much”. The 2 exceptions are the 2 items of
the Global Health Status/QoL scale, which patients are asked to rate on
a 7-point scale from “Very poor” to “Excellent”.</p>
<p>The scoring procedure for the QLQ-C30<strong>[REF 3]</strong>
transforms all of the scale and single-item scores to range from 0 to
100. High scores for the Global Health Status/QoL scale represents high
QoL, high scores for the functional scales represent high/healthy levels
of functioning, but high scores for the symptom scales/items represent
high levels of symptomatology/problems. The newer overall summary score
also ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better
functioning and lower levels of symptoms. Accurate scoring for the EORTC
QLQ-C30 (version 3.0), including the newer overall summary score, is
available in the <em>PROscorer</em> R package using the
<strong><code>qlq_c30()</code></strong> function<strong>[REF
4]</strong>. The QLQ-C30 has been extensively validated and is widely
used in clinical trials. The multi-item scales generally have good
internal consistency reliability coefficients<strong>[REF
1]</strong>.</p>
