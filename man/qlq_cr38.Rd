\title{Score the EORTC QLQ-CR38 Quality of Life Questionnaire}
\usage{
qlq_cr38(df, items = NULL, keepNvalid = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing responses to the 38 QLQ-CR38 items, and
possibly other variables.}

\item{items}{A character vector with the QLQ-CR38 item names, or a numeric
vector indicating the column numbers of the QLQ-CR38 items in \code{df}.
If \code{items} is omitted, then \code{qlq_CR38} will assume that
\code{df} contains \strong{ONLY} the QLQ-CR38 items and no other variables.
See Details for more information.}

\item{keepNvalid}{Logical, whether to return variables containing the
number of valid, non-missing items on each scale for each respondent should
be returned in the data frame with the scale scores.  The default is
\code{FALSE}.  Set to \code{TRUE} to return these variables, which will be
named \code{"scalename_N"} (e.g., \code{QL_N}).  Most users should omit
this argument entirely.  This argument might be removed from future
versions of the package, so please let me know if you think this argument
useful and would rather it remain a part of the function.}
}
\value{
A data frame with all 12 of the QLQ-CR38 scores is returned.  Of the 12
scores, 4 are Functional Scales and 8 are Symptom Scales (see below).  Of the
8 Symptom Scales, 1 is based on a single item and 7 are multi-item scales.
Of the 4 Functional Scales, 2 are multi-item and 2 are based on single items.
All scores are scaled to range from 0-100, even scores based on single items.
Be aware that these single-item scales still have only 4 possible values,
even though they are transformed to range from 0-100.  The scale names and
numbers of items are listed below.

\description{
Scores the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CR38 Colorectal Cancer Module. (Experimental: This
function was written quickly... please hand score 1 or 2 patients and check
for accuracy)
}
\details{
This function returns a total of 12 different scores from the EORTC
QLQ-CR38. The scoring instructions for the QLQ-CR38 are no longer available
from the EORTC, and the QLQ-CR38 seems to have been superseded by the
QLQ-CR29.  This function calculates the QLQ-CR38 scores based on an old SPSS
syntax file from the EORTC, and from Sprangers et al. (1999).

In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-CR38 item
responses (\code{df}), you need to tell the function how to find the
variables that correspond to the QLQ-CR38 items in \code{df}.  You can do this
in 1 of 2 ways:
\enumerate{
\item The first way is to manually provide the item names or locations
using the \code{items} argument.  For example, if your first 10
variables in \code{df} contain demographics, followed by the 38 QLQ-CR38
items \strong{in order} starting with the 11th variable, then you could
use \code{items = 11:48}.
\item The second way only applies if your data frame (\code{df}) contains
\strong{ONLY} the 38 variables corresponding to the 38 QLQ-CR38 items,
in order, with no other non-QLQ-CR38 variables.  In this case, you can
just use the \code{df} argument and omit \code{items}.
}
}
\note{
Some of the QLQ-CR38 items/scales are not applicable to all patients.  There
are 2 questions for men only, 2 questions for women only, 7 questions only
for patients WITHOUT a stoma (colostomy bag), and 7 questions only for
patients WITH a stoma.  Patients will therefore have missing values for some
of the scale scores.

\strong{Functional Scales (higher is better functioning)}
\itemize{
\item \strong{CR_BI} - Body Image (3 items)
\item \strong{CR_SX} - Sexual Functioning (2 items)
\item \strong{CR_SE} - Sexual Enjoyment (1 item)
\item \strong{CR_FU} - Future Perspective (1 item)
}

\strong{Symptom Scales (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)}
\itemize{
\item \strong{CR_MI}  - Micturition Problems (3 items)
\item \strong{CR_GI}  - Gastrointestinal Tract Symptoms (5 items)
\item \strong{CR_CT}  - Chemotherapy Side-Effects (3 items)
\item \strong{CR_DF}  - Problems with Defacation (Only for Pts WITHOUT a stoma) (7 items)
\item \strong{CR_STO} - Stoma-Related Problems (Only for Pts w/stoma) (7 items)
\item \strong{CR_MSX} - Male Sexual Problems (2 items)
\item \strong{CR_FSX} - Female Sexual Problems (2 items)
\item \strong{CR_WL}  - Weight Loss (1 item)
}

Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
\code{keepNvalid = TRUE}, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
}
\section{How Missing Data is Handled}{

The \code{qlq_cr38} function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing
items are pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values
are identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
