Description: An extensible repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to
    score commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life
    (QOL), and other psychometric and psychological measures.
    'PROscorer', together with the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system
    to facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into research studies
    and clinical settings in a scientifically rigorous and reproducible
    manner.  These packages and their vignettes are intended to help
    establish and promote "best practices" to improve the planning,
    scoring, and reporting of PRO-like measures in research.  The
    'PROscorer' "Instrument Descriptions" vignette contains descriptions
    of each instrument scored by 'PROscorer', complete with references.
    These instrument descriptions are suitable for inclusion in formal
    study protocol documents, grant proposals, and manuscript Method
    sections.  Each 'PROscorer' function is composed of helper functions
    from the 'PROscorerTools' package, and users are encouraged to
    contribute new functions to 'PROscorer'.  More scoring functions are
    currently in development and will be added in future updates.
